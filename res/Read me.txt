Thank you for downloading my Basic RPG Sound Effects pack! This pack contains sound effects with custom produced square waves and noise waves.
All included sound effects are formatted as M4A and OGG files and can be directly imported into RPG Maker projects (and other engines).

This pack is free to use! You can credit me as May Genko. Or not. That's up to you (credits are cool, though)!


Enjoy!
